# My Digital Garden
Here, I showcase my academic projects from the **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS)** program, aiming to inspire and guide other students navigating similar courses.

ðŸŒŸ Featured Courses:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Advanced Projects in Machine Learning
- Bayesian Statistics

Each project includes detailed descriptions, methodologies, and outcomes, offering a clear roadmap for tackling QMSS projects. I'll also acknowledge and highlight the contributions of my amazing colleagues, whose teamwork and support were instrumental in bringing these ideas to life.

Feel free to explore and learnâ€”this space is all about sharing knowledge and growing together!
